# jaromero's dotfiles

Includes (for now) the following kind of configs:

* Bash (bash_profile, bashrc, profile)
* zsh (uses [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh))
* [Infinality](http://www.infinality.net) tweaks

Symlink to the appropriate places, or [use with effuse](https://github.com/programble/effuse): `effuse -p .`

TODO: Figure out how to integrate [my dotvim repository](https://github.com/jaromero/dotvim) and not break everything

TODO: Also figure out how to include my [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) settings. Ideally with packages, or with an easy way to reinstall them.
